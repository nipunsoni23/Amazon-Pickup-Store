  <h1>About Pickup Stores</h1>
  <p>Instead of delivering a package to your home or business address, you can choose to have your order delivered to an
    Amazon pickup location with One-Day/Two-Day pickup options, so you can collect it at a time that's convenient for
    you. Once your package is delivered to the pickup location, you'll receive an e-mail notification. These fast track
    pick up options are currently available only in select pincodes of Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. </p>
